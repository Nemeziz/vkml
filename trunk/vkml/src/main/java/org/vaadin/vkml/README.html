<h1>Online KML editor</h1>

<p>This is a simple GIS software that uses KML as its base format.
Currently one can only maintain a simple database of areas, but there
are some plans to add other features to it in the future (lines,
markers, style editor). Currently this is mostly just a technology POC,
but it also intends to serve as an application keep up to date digital
copy of a hunting clubs hunting areas. Essential data in this use case
is actual areas, name, details and a hierarchical structure (folders).
Updating similar data with Google Earth would easily produce a "dirty"
file structure for further use. KML was chosen as a base format because
KML files can be viewed in several free applications like in Google
Earth, but are also supported by several GPS devices.</p>
